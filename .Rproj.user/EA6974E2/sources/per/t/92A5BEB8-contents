## 1. 景观组成和格局对地表温度的影响：东南亚特大城市热岛研究[^1]

![STE-RonaldEstoque-2017](https://wxx-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/STE-RonaldEstoque-2017.jpg)

### 1.1 简介

热岛效应（UHI）的起源与定义：Urban heat island (UHI), a phenomenon first described in 1818, refers to the phenomenon of higher atmospheric and surface temperatures occurring in urban areas than in the surrounding rural areas (Howard, 1818; Oke and Hannel, 1970; Voogt and Oke, 2003; Voogt, 2004; EPA, 2008).

地表热岛的昼夜差异：Surface UHIs are typically present day and night, but tend to be strongest during the day due to the radiation from the sun (EPA, 2008).

热岛效应的成因：the UHI phenomenon is influenced by the reduced vegetation in urban areas, properties of urban materials, urban geometry, **anthropogenic heat**, weather, and location (Voogt, 2004; EPA, 2008).【人为热量】

热岛效应的危害：Some of the major negative impacts of UHI include increased energy consumption, elevated emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gasses, compromised human health and comfort, and impaired water quality (Voogt, 2004; EPA, 2008).

绿地的积极效用：Some of the major negative impacts of UHI include increased energy consumption, elevated emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gasses, compromised human health and comfort, and impaired water quality (Voogt, 2004; EPA, 2008).

研究方法：**城乡梯度分析**（围绕中心创建缓冲区），多分辨率网格分析，空间结构分析，统计分析

数据提取：不透水面的斑块大小、形状复杂度、紧凑度 Fragstats v4.2.1 software

### 1.3 结果与讨论

城市无论大小和位置如何，都会产生热岛效应，这种效应通常会随着城市规模的减小而减小：cities produce UHI regardless of size and location, though the effect often decreases as city size decreases.

绿色空间对地表温度的影响低于提高地表温度的不透水表面：The impact of green space on surface temperatures is lower than impervious surface that elevates surface temperatures.

考虑到当地背景气候可能随空间和时间发生巨大变化，LST在地理位置和时间段上可能存在很大差异：LSTs may differ greatly across geographic locations and time periods considering that local background climate may vary greatly with space and time (Zhou et al., 2016b).

城市城乡梯度上的平均LST模式显示了存在中心密度火山口的证据，该火山口具有边缘或波峰：the zones closest to the city center did not have the highest mean LST. The pattern of mean LST along the urban-rural gradients of the three cities shows evidence for the presence of a central density crater with a rim or crest.【考虑应用梯度分析】

随着网格尺寸的增加，不透水面密度与平均LST之间的相关性呈增加趋势，绿地密度和平均LST之间的相关性呈下降趋势，表明在较小的区域测量时，绿地对LST变化的影响更大。【分辨率对结果的影像】

有效影响地表温度的一组土地覆盖类型的最佳区域或源区为210 m×210 m至240 m×240 m正方形。

不透水表面对地表温度的影响大于绿地：In general, the slope values of green space vs. mean LST for all cities are consistently lower than the slope values of impervious surface vs.mean LST. This also confirms the earlier finding that impervious surface has a higher impact on LST than green space.

总斑块边缘的增加可能会增强绿地及其周围区域之间的能量流动和交换，并为周围表面提供更多的阴影，从而导致更低的LST：It is because the increase of total patch edges may enhance energy flow and exchange between green space and its surrounding areas, and provide more shade for surrounding surfaces, which results to a much lower LST (Zhou et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012).

零散或分散的植被在缓解城市变暖效应方面不如丛生植被有效，聚集的人造表面或聚集的建筑材料极大地提高了城市温度：In general, fragmented or dispersed vegetation is less effective in mitigating urban warming effect than clustered vegetation. On the other hand, clustered man-made features or aggregated built materials drastically elevate urban temperatures. 

**两类措施**：一是绿色屋顶、凉爽屋顶和凉爽路面在缓解城市热岛效应方面的潜力，以及城市设计和几何结构（包括建筑物的大小、形状和方向）对气流的影响；二是城市绿化，即引入、维护或改善城市绿地。

### 2.1 简介

在日益城市化的世界中，通过增加植被覆盖来减少城市热岛的空间已所剩无几：Since most land surfaces are occupied by impervious surfaces in highly urbanized areas, there is not much space left to reduce urban heat island through increasing vegetation cover in an increasingly urbanized world. 绿地的空间配置更加重要：the high priority should be placed on the configuration of green space.

传统气象站数据的局限性：Earlier urban-rural heat research was conducted based on meteorological observations (Fast et al., 2005;Chowand Roth, 2006). Due to the sparsely distributed observation sites, it is difficult to gain a holistic understanding on spatial distribution temperature for such studies. 

三个目标：（1）描述城市群城乡梯度的LST趋势；（2） 检测城市群内各城市地表温度趋势的驱动因素；（3） 根据三个典型的城市化强度（低、中、高），确定城市内地表温度的驱动因素。

### 2.2 数据与方法

研究区域：长三角城市群的26个城市

数据来源：LST--MODIS数据 Aqua MODIS 8-days composite products with aresolution of 1 km (MYD11A2, version 5 Wan et al., 2015). The LST products were comprised of daytime (13:30) and nighttime (01:30) observations.

土地类型数据--中国国家土地利用和覆盖变化（CNLUCC）数据集。It was derived from visual interpretation of Landsat 8 OLI and GF-2 satellite imagery, with reference to the well-established national land use and land cover remote sensing classification system (Liu et al., 2005), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ground survey observation system, and further evaluation by the peer experts (Ning et al., 2018). 

LST的影响因素：The potential driving forces of LST in this study included background climate, vegetation greenness, landscape structure (composition and configuration) of both green space and urban land, population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and albedo for the corresponding year of 2015.

其他数据来源：**MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data** with a spatial resolution of 250 m  250 m (MOD13Q1)；Three landscape metrics: mean patch size (AREAMN), mean shape index (SHAPEMN), and aggregation index (AI) were calculated for each 1 km  1 km grid using Fragstats 3.3 with 8 cell neighborhood (McGarigal et al., 2002). The population and GDP data for each 1 km  1 km LST grid were collected from the Resources and Environmental Science Data Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn; Xu, 2017a,b).

### 2.3 结果与讨论

LST通常随城市强度的增加而增加，但随季节和白天/夜间而变化：The LST generally increased with increasing urban intensity but varied with season and daytime/nighttime. 

盐城市的冬季白天表现出冷岛效应，LST与城市强度的线性系数为负：while one city (Yancheng) showed cold island effect with negative LST–urban intensity linear coefficient. 夜晚4个城市存在冷岛效应。【建成区面积影响LST存在差异化结果，与季节和昼夜有关】

气候因素（温带、降水、蒸发）对高城市化地区的LST变化的贡献最小。绿地和城市土地的景观结构（组成和配置）随着城市化强度的增加而发挥着越来越大的作用，尽管其贡献相对于增强的植被指数（EVI）仍然很小：The results showed that EVI was the dominant drivers for LST variation in summer day for the cities. The contribution of climate drivers (temperate, precipitation, evaporation) to LST variation in high urban intensity bins was the lowest among three typical urban intensity gradients. In contrast, the landscape structure (composition and configuration) of both greenspace and urban land played an increasing role with increasing unban intensity, although its contribution was still small relative to EVI.

长江三角洲城市群大多数城市夏季和冬季白天和夜间的地表温度均随城市强度的增加而显著增加：LST significantly increased with rising urban intensity during the day and night both in summer and winter for most cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration.

城市群区域内，随着城市强度的增加，地表温度的变化趋势存在明显的**空间异质性**。这两个季节白天和夜间的不同模式可能主要是由于确定的主要驱动因素不同：There was significant spatial heterogeneity in trends of LST
along rising urban intensity among the Urban Agglomeration region. The different patterns during the day and night in both seasons might be largely due to the different identified dominant drivers. 【证明空间变系数模型的重要性】

绿色斑块边缘的增加以及形状复杂性的增加增强了绿色斑块与周围环境之间的能量流动，这也可以降低农村地区的地表温度：The increases of green patch edges along with increasing shape complexity enhance the energy flow between green patches and surrounding environment, which could also lower the rural area LST. The negative relationship between LST and green patches shape complexity was supported by other studies (Zhou et al., 2011; Maimaitiyiming et al., 2014).

城市规模（由GDP和城市面积反映）可以对LST——城市强度趋势做出积极贡献，尤其是在冬季夜晚：We also find that in this urban agglomeration, the urban size (reflected by GDP and urban AREAMN) could contribute positively to LST–urban intensity trends especially in winter night. This denotes that in winter night, the LST–urban intensity trends were mainly contributed by anthropogenic heat emissions. **The nighttime LST–urban intensity trends were the consequence of more surface heat storage in highly urbanized area due to anthropogenic heat emissions from industrial, traffic and air conditioner within domestic buildings.**【人为热排放在冬季对LST的影响】

一旦城市化强度超过临界阈值，减缓气候变化的空间就非常有限：the space for climate mitigation is very limited once the urbanization intensity exceeds critical thresholds.

忽略了到城市核心的物理距离，这是影响城市热环境的另一个关键指标：it omitted the physical distance to urban core, another critical indicator affecting urban thermal environment.【强调空间位置的重要性】

LST不仅由相应的像素决定，还受相邻像素的影响：The LST is not only determined by the corresponding pixel, but also affected by the adjacent pixels.【强调使用空间自回归模型的重要性】

我们专注于从城市土地和绿地的现有景观构成和配置中确定可能的散热解决方案，这些方案在城市规划和设计中比水体更可行：We focus on identifying the possible heat mitigating solutions from already-existed landscape composition and configuration of urban land and green space, which are more feasible to adopt in urban planning and design than water bodies.
