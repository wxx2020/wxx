### 1.1 简介

全球变暖的危害：Higher temperatures contribute to more intense heat waves, droughts and storms, sea level rise and destructive floods, affecting food security and the habitability of low-lying regions, but also species composition of local ecosystems (Bruelheide, 2003; Del Barrio et al., 2006; EEA, 2012; IPCC, 2013; MEA, 2005; Schröter et al., 2005). 影响人体健康和工作能力，高温热浪致死案例增加。

热岛效应的原因：The UHI effect results from the replacement of natural with impervious, non-evaporative surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. The dominance of surfaces with high solar radiation absorption and heat storage in combination with little space for vegetation or water bodies results in a modified climate that is usually warmer than the surrounding rural areas.

热岛效应与人口密度或城市规模没有关系：The global study of 419 big cities found no relation between UHI intensity and population density or city size, but emphasizes the key role of urban vegetation cover and activity (Peng et al., 2012).

空气温度与地表温度具有相似的时空模式并且具有非常强的相关关系：Air temperatures and surface temperatures show similar spatial and temporal pattern and a number of studies have shown that they are well related (Arnfield, 2003; Schwarz, Schlink, Franck, & Grossmann, 2012; Voogt & Oke, 2003). 

四个研究问题：

- 城市热岛效应是“大城市”的一种特殊现象吗？还是几平方公里大小的小城镇也可以观察到城市热岛效应？
- 景观构成是否影响城市地表温度或UHI强度？
- 植被指数（NDVI）能否用于估算UHI强度？
- 考虑农村地区对城市热岛效应强度进行定量评估的相关性如何？

### 1.2 方法

研究区域：意大利南蒂罗尔省的77个城市

数据来源：Landset 5 和Landset 7 1984-2011年

研究方法：t检验，皮尔逊相关系数，线性回归

### 1.3 结果

城市的地表温度与乡村的地表温度具有非常强烈的相关性：The land surface temperatures LSTurban and LSTland were very strong correlated (r = 0.97).

城市与乡村地表温度的差距随着温度升高而扩大：The increase of LSTurban with increasing irradiance is therefore higher than the increase of LSTland, so that the difference between LSTurban and LSTland becomes larger at higher temperatures or radiation levels.

热岛效应存在与否与城市规模大小无关，这与之前的研究结论不一致：The urban heat island effect is indeed expected to be observable for all kinds of settlements, independent of size (Oke, 1982).

城乡植被指数（NDVI）差异是影响城乡地表温度差距的主要因素：The urban–rural NDVI difference (NDVI) was identified as a major determinate of the magnitude of the urban–rural temperature difference.

太阳辐射度是影响城市热岛效应的另一个重要驱动力：The relevance of the irradiance results from the different response of urban and natural surfaces to solar radiation caused by differences in absorption, evapotranspiration, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and many other factors (Arnfield, 2003; Bowler et al., 2010; Voogt & Oke, 2003). 

城市和乡村对太阳辐射的差异主要是由各自不同的地表特征决定的：This different response of the urban area and the surrounding landscape to irradiance is caused by their different surface characteristics. 植被特征的差异：Due to a high difference in dense, healthy, photosynthetic active vegetation that is associated with high differences in absorption and evapotranspiration. 

尚未有研究证明城乡土地覆盖在影响地表温度时存在相互作用：No evidence was found for interactions between urban areas and surrounding landscape in the sense that land cover affects the urban temperature. 

城市周边景观（即乡村景观）对定量评估城市热岛效应至关重要：The consideration of the surrounding landscape is of crucial importance for quantitative assessments of UHI intensity.

### 2.1 简介

城镇化对景观生态的影响：From the perspective of landscape ecology, urbanization is a process of transforming natural landscapes such as vegetation cover, water bodies, and agrarian lands into manmade impervious surfaces containing cement, asphalt, metal, and other chemical materials. 

城市景观生态变化对热岛效应的影响：The transformation abates land surface evaporation and moisture availability, elevates sensible heat fluxes (Carlson, Dodd, Benjamin, & Cooper, 1981; Owen, Carlson, & Gillies, 1998), reduces precipitation (Kaufmann et al., 2007), eliminates farmland reserves (Seto, Kaufmann, & Woodcock, 2000), modifies urban thermal environment, and leads to the urban heat island effect (Seto et al., 2010).

景观构成与景观配置的区别：landscape composition and landscape configuration. The former identifies each land-cover type and describes its relative abundance without referring to its spatial features, whereas the latter represents the physical distribution of patches within a landscape mosaic. 

已有研究的不足之处：单一空间尺度的研究，忽略了空间自相关的影响。

### 2.2 数据与方法

研究区域：北京市海淀和昌平交接地区，约70平方公里

数据来源：2002年5月22日 Landset 7，基于图像分析的Quickbird 数据

研究方法：空间自相关分析与空间回归

### 2.3 结果

热量的空间流动造成地表温度的空间自相关：Since heat flows from a high-temperature area to neighboring low-temperature areas, LST is spatially auto-correlated.

随着空间分辨率减低，地表温度的空间自相关程度也随之减弱：when resolution decreases, spatial dependency becomes weaker, with Z-scores dropping from 157.82 to 4.77.

随着空间分辨率降低，景观构成对地表温度的影响增强，而周边温度的影响降低：This indicates that as a scale becomes coarser, the impact of landscape compositions becomes stronger, but the influence of the autocorrelation of LST becomes weaker. 

660米和720米这两个空间尺度最适合分析地表温度和景观构成之间的关系。

使用空间回归模型的两个优势：The advantages of using spatial regression models to measure the relationships between LST and landscape compositions are twofold. On the one hand, it increases the overall fitness of the model substantially by adding the autocorrelation of the dependent variable as an explanatory variable. On the other hand, because spatial regression models do not require independence between observations, parameter estimates are much more reliable.

研究发现，在更细的尺度下，LST受周围LST的影响更大，而在更粗的尺度上，LST受景观组成的影响更大。随着分辨率的降低，大多数类型的土地覆盖对地表温度的影响减弱：LST has been found to be affected more by surrounding LSTs at finer scales and by landscape compositions at coarser scales. The impacts of most types of land-cover on LST become weaker as the resolution decreases.

### 2.4 展望

景观配置结构和经济社会因素的影响研究有待补充：further studies need to be conducted focusing not only on the biophysical features of urban land use and land cover, but also on socioeconomic factors, such as population, GDP, the number of vehicles, etc.
