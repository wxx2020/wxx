### 1.1 简介

土地覆盖类型的空间组成和结构：Spatial composition of the urban environment refers to the different land use categories, their total area, and the relative proportions (Gustafson, 1998). spatial configuration describes the spatial pattern of urban LULC patches in terms of shape, density, connectivity and complexity (Gustafson, 1998).

两个目标：（1）使用Moran I检验相邻美国主要城市土地覆盖类型的空间聚类与LST之间的实证关系。（2）分析每个城市的区域气候背景对这种关系的潜在影响。

### 1.2 数据与方法

研究区域：美国的7个大城市

数据来源：土地覆盖数据--the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products

​                    LST数据--2011年的六月至八月MODIS LST 8day composite product (MOD11A2.V006, version 6)

研究方法：Moran's I用来计算各类土地的集聚度，相关分析与多元回归分析

### 1.3 结果与讨论

聚集的水体在白天有冷却作用，但在夜间有**增温作用**。在大多数城市，混合类型的土地覆盖通常与地表温度呈负相关：clustered water bodies have a cooling effect during the day, but a warming effect at night, except for Phoenix. Mixed types of land cover generally show a negative correlation with LST in most cities but not many results are statistically significant. 【水体对LST的影响存在昼夜差异】

无论城市的区域背景气候如何，在大多数城市，聚集的不透水表面都会提高白天和夜间的LST，白天高于晚上：clustered impervious surfaces could elevate LST for both daytime and nighttime in most cities, regardless of the regional background climate of a city. the warming effect of clustered impervious surface is stronger during the daytime than the nighttime. 

不透水面的影响机制：This is because clustered impervious surfaces increase ground heat fluxes and sensible heat fluxes during the daytime by efficiently converting shortwave radiation from the solar energy into longwave radiation to heat up the lower atmosphere quickly, but reduce latent heat fluxes by decreasing evapotranspiration from soil-vegetation systems (Oke, 1982; Ma, Wu, & He, 2016). Furthermore, clustered impervious surfaces can also indirectly augment anthropogenic heat emissions from transportation, industries, and building infrastructure, all of which lead to increased LST (Zhang, Imhoff, Wolfe, & Bounoua, 2010; Zhou, Zhao, Liu, Zhang & Zhu, 2014; Kuang et al., 2015). During the night, anthropogenic heat becomes impervious surfaces’ main energy source due to the loss of solar energy, which significantly decreases the efficiency of energy transfer. Therefore, LST drops significantly after sunset.【人类活动增加热排放，在晚上称为影响LST的主要因素】

水体较大的比热容决定了它对LST的影响存在昼夜差异：The effects of spatial clustering of water bodies on LST is reversed because of the higher specific heat capacity of water compared to other materials in urban environments, such as anthropogenic materials and open soils. These materials’ surface temperature far exceeds water bodies during the daytime by quickly absorbing shortwave radiation from solar energy. Moreover, they emit heat through longwave radiation after sunset and their temperature drops quickly. Water bodies’ temperature remains relatively constant during the entire day. Therefore, the spatial clustering of water bodies shows a cooling effect during the daytime, but a potential warming effect at night, especially during the winter (Oke, 1982; Kim, 1992; Wang et al., 2018).

碎片化城市建设的双面影响：Even though building smaller area and more dispersed impervious surfaces can potentially reduce urban heating and alleviate the UHI effect, it is still unsustainable as it may threaten both the natural and rural environments, raising more greenhouse gas emissions, creating more air and noise pollutions, and causing less efficient energy use (EEA, 2006). 【屋顶绿化被推荐】

城市形态的影响需要重视：more research should be done to understand how urban morphology, such as building height and shape, influences urban warming.

### 2.1 简介

城市近地表热环境的空间异质性：The urban landscape is a highly complex and heterogeneous area resulting from the combination of ecological and social determinants. Urban morphology, which has significant impacts on the spatial-temporal variability of solar heat gain on urban surfaces, has been identified to be one of the main parameters influencing urban thermal environment at neighborhood scale (Johansson, 2006).

城市热岛的原因及危害：Urbanization is one of the most significant factors driving land transformations from natural ecosystems and agricultural lands to impervious surfaces (Ng, Xie, & Yu, 2011). Such conversions alter near-surface energy budget and introduce the so-called Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in urban area. High temperatures can substantially impact energy consumption, environmental quality, and human health (Battaglia, Douglas, & Hennigan, 2017; Patz, Campbell-Lendrum, Holloway, & Foley, 2005; Vargo, Stone, Habeeb, Liu, & Russell, 2016).

高密度建筑的阴影效应有助于改善热辐射：The shadow-cast effect by buildings helps in reducing radiant temperature and improving thermal comfort condition especially in high-density cities (Lindberg & Grimmond, 2011; Morakinyo, Kong, Lau, Yuan, & Ng, 2017). 【建筑密度的双向效应】

人类活动的影响：Urban landscape patterns are significantly related to biophysical factors and human activities.

三个目标：（1）探索与几个不同温度等级相关的LST的空间异质性，（2）通过探索几个气候敏感参数与每个温度等级的LST之间的关系，识别控制LST异质性的参数，（3）为在城市功能区范围内提出缓解影响的建议提供基础，以减弱城市内表面热岛效应。

### 2.2 数据与方法

研究方法：从整个区域、温度等级和城市功能区等三个方面进行逐步回归

### 2.3 结果与讨论

不同功能区的温度差异：高密度住宅区和商业区LST普遍较高，而休闲区则普遍较低。【采用POI来确定功能区】

影响温度在不同温区表现出差异化的影响。【可以采用GWR方法】

随着在越来越小的空间尺度上研究LST，土地利用参数的解释力显著下降，城市景观往往在更精细的空间尺度上更具异质性：We found that as we examined LSTs at increasingly smaller spatial scales, the explanatory power of land use parameters declined significantly, which is consistent with the study of previous study Zhou, Wang, and Cadenasso, (2017). Other researchers have also found that urban landscapes are often more heterogeneous at finer spatial scales (Hamstead, Kremer, Larondelle, Mcphearson, & Haase, 2016). That is, a given parameter often does not provide the same effectiveness in explaining LSTs at all spatial scales. In addition, there are different combinations of parameters that can be included into stepwise regression models at different spatial scales, at different temperatures, or for different urban functional zones. This wide variation in reduced effectiveness of explanatory variables in heterogeneous environments suggests that not only are some variables scale-dependent, but also that non-stationary relationships exist between LSTs and complex controlling factors. To better explore the spatial scale-dependent relationships between LST and its driving forces, we suggest that appropriate parameters be chosen in future study to match the particular scale in which they will be used.【使用MGWR的重要性】
