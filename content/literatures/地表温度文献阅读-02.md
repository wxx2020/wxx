### 1.1 简介

全球变暖的原因：城镇化 The rapid growth of urbanization and the development of areas covered with man-made land cover versus the lower the level of natural cover is one of the main causes of global climate change (Streutker, 2002; Touchaei & Wang, 2015). Population growth in urban areas, especially in developing countries, puts a lot of pressure on natural resources and causes gradual loss of these resources (Amiri, Weng, Alimohammadi, & Alavipanah, 2009; Feizizadeh & Blaschke, 2013; Peron, De Maria, Spinazzè, & Mazzali, 2015). Expansion of synthetic surfaces is a marker for centralized human activities that lead to an increase in Earth’s surface temperature (Su, Gu, & Yang, 2010).

城市物理表面对其小气候的影响：Cities with different physical surfaces than the surrounding environments (rural areas) influence on their microclimate (Cai, Du, & Xue, 2011; Meng & Liu, 2013). The behavior of urban surfaces is far different from the behavioral pattern of natural surfaces in terms of the absorption of shortwave and long wave radiation, evaporation, release of man-made heat, and the block of prevailing wind (Mirzaei & Haghighat, 2010). 

特大城市活动对气候的影响：Megacities with compact constructions and a variety of activities, especially in the CBD, fully affect on their climate and the climate of surroundings (Boehme, Berger, & Massier, 20105; Morris et al., 2015).

城市布局（建筑和街道）的影响：A complex network of high-rise buildings and narrow streets, that makes trapping the heat absorbed during the day, impairs air circulation and consequently the process of reducing the temperature in urban areas. 

LST与热岛效应的关系：In studies of urban climate change, the LST has been recognized as one of the most important parameters affecting the UHI phenomenon (Liu & Zhang, 2011). 

遥感数据与传统气象站比较的优势：In the absence of regular and dense network of ground weather stations, temporal and spatial distribution of LST based on thermal imaging can be used to supply the required input data for the study of UHI (Feizizadeh, Blaschke, Nazmfar, Akbari, & Kohbanani, 2013).

三个目标：（1）利用Landsat TM卫星图像研究德黑兰的LST；（2）LST的空间分布及其与LULC和归一化差异植被指数（NDVI）的关系分析；（3）分析LST与**人口密度**的关系及其对研究区域**能源消耗**和**居民健康**的影响。

### 1.2 数据与方法

研究区域：伊朗首都德黑兰

数据来源：2010年8月7日的Landset 遥感影像

研究方法：制图比较观察，线性回归

### 1.3 结果分析

人类活动与UHI：Heavy road and air traffic, and large volume of public and private vehicles, as well as a variety of pollutants caused by them are the most important negative aspects of this district. 

水体和居住区受UHI的影响较小：water bodies and residential areas with low to relatively medium population density are less-influenced from the UHI compared to the largely-affected areas. 

在人口稠密的城区进行大面积绿化是不现实的：water bodies and residential areas with low to relatively medium population density are less-influenced from the UHI compared to the largely-affected areas. 建筑屋顶绿化是可行的方案。

NDVI和LST之间的负相关可能受到土壤水分和蒸散状况等因素的影响：the negative correlation between NDVI and LST may be affected by factors such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration status。【考虑采用空间杜宾模型】

LST与NDVI的负向关系：there is a negative correlation between the LST and NDVI so that the surface temperature of land will increase by reducing the amount of vegetation cover.

高密度人口从两方面影响LST：High density of population in an area and consequently the expansion of settlements and highrise residential buildings, on one hand, can cause the energy to be trapped in walls due to high heat capacity, and on the other hand, lead to excessive use of artificial cooling systems by residents and anthropogenic heat in the city.

### 1.4 结论

工业工厂、机场、裸地和密集住宅区是受UHI影响最大的土地用途：Industrial factories, airports, bare lands, and dense residential areas are the land uses more affected by UHI. 

研究区域不同地区的人口密度反映了人类活动对能源消耗和热岛加剧的影响：population density in different parts of the study area reflects the impact of human activities on the energy consumption and intensification of heat islands.

### 2.1 简介

三类城市热岛效应：地表热岛；冠层热岛；边界层热岛。后两种属于空气热岛

NDVI和NDBI的含义：A higher NDVI indicates the higher probability of vegetation (Han, Chen, & Feng, 2015). The NDBI can reveal the built-up and barren land of urban areas (Chen et al., 2006; Zhou & Wang, 2011)

NDVI与LST的关系受到季节变化的影响：NDVI may influence the results of land surface UHI analysis because it is susceptible to seasonal variations (Zhang et al., 2009). 

除了地表覆盖特征外，城市形态也对UHI存在较大影响：The most influential factors for controlling the UHI are the distribution of surface cover characteristics, and urban morphology, such as building materials, geometry, and density (Li et al., 2013). Moreover, the intensity of UHI is influenced by the change of urban surface characteristics, such as spatial extent and composition of vegetation or built-up areas and the spatial arrangement of the urban land uses (Martilli 2014; Debbage & Shepherd 2015). 

三个目标：（1）定量比较LST的模式和强度；（2） 定量研究城市地表特征与地表温度的关系；（3） 研究这些关系是如何随时间变化的，并试图找出哪一种关系相对稳定。

### 2.2 数据与方法

研究区域：昆明大都市圈 2622平方公里，包括主城区、城乡结合部和郊区

数据来源：Landset的卫星影像数据 美国地质调查局（USGS）地球资源观测和科学（EROS）中心档案下载(http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)中国地理空间数据云(http://www.gscloud.cn/)，气温和降水数据来自中国国家气候中心(http://ncc.cma.gov.cn/).

根据NDVI值的大小，进行分类：当NDVI>0.7时，可视为全植被覆盖；当NDVI<0.05时，可视为裸土；0.05时≤ NDVI≤ 0.7，发射率可通过方程式计算。

研究方法：Pearson相关分析与多元回归分析

### 2.3 结果与讨论

UHII和LST的分布几乎完全一致：the distribution of UHIII and LST could also be found that was almost entirely consistent.【表明LST可以用来衡量UHI】

地表的异质性可能是导致LST变化范围更广的原因：Heterogeneous property of land surface might be the reasons that contributed to wider variations of LSTs.【考虑空间变系数模型】

人类行为会影响土地利用/覆盖类型的UHI强度解释：human behaviours would influence the UHI intensity interpretation of land use/cover types (Chen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009).
